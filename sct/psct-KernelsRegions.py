#
# This script is a PSyclone (https://github.com/stfc/PSyclone) transformation
# script for the annotation of potentially parallelisable code regions with
# OpenACC directives in order to instruct OpenACC-enabled Fortran compilers to
# prepare such regions for execution on a GPGPU accelerator. Starting from
# array assignments and computational kernels within spatial and tracer loops
# identified by PScylone, it iteratively grows such seed regions i) through
# merging of neighbouring regions, ii) by including scalar assignments, and
# iii) by hoisting the scope of regions to include surrouding spatial and
# tracer loops or if constructs, until a steady state is reached. This script
# can be regarded as an alternative implementation of the recursive
# 'kernels_trans.py' and 'acc_kernels_trans.py' transformation scripts of
# PSyclone version 2.4.0
# (<PSYCLONE_2_4_0_ROOT>/examples/nemo/scripts/kernels_trans.py) and PSyclone
# version 2.5.0
# (<PSYCLONE_2_5_0_ROOT>/examples/nemo/scripts/acc_kernels_trans.py),
# respectively.
#
# The entry point of the transformation script is procedure 'trans'. This
# script could be used directly with the 'psyclone' command (e.g., via the NEMO
# build system), but it can also be incorporated into a
# "super-transformation-script" that collates various PSyclone transformation
# scripts (such as sct/psct-OpenACC.py).
#
# This script has been developed by building the NEMO BENCH test case from the
# transformed source code using the Cray Fortran Compiler version 15.0.0 with
# option '-hacc'; the module procedures listed in variable
# ROUTINES_REJECT_PREFIXES are excluded in order to avoid failures during the
# build process of this configuration.
